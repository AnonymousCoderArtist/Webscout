## 🎯 Usage Example

```python

images = imager.generate("Epic dragon breathing fire", amount=2)
paths = imager.save(images)

# Async way
from webscout.Provider.TTI import AsyncDeepInfraImager
import asyncio

async def generate_art():
    imager = AsyncDeepInfraImager(logging=True)
    images = await imager.generate("Cyberpunk city at night")
    paths = await imager.save(images)

asyncio.run(generate_art())
```

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
pip install webscout
```

## 📚 Common Interface

All providers implement these base classes:
- `ImageProvider` for sync operations
- `AsyncImageProvider` for async operations

### 🎨 Common Methods

```python
def generate(
    self,
    prompt: str,           # Your creative prompt
    amount: int = 1,       # Number of images
    max_retries: int = 3,  # Max retry attempts
    retry_delay: int = 5   # Delay between retries
) -> List[bytes]:         # Returns image data
    ...

def save(
    self,
    response: List[bytes], # Image data
    name: str = None,      # Base filename
    dir: str = os.getcwd(),# Save directory
    prefix: str = ""       # Filename prefix
) -> List[str]:           # Returns saved paths
    ...
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling

All providers use these standard exceptions:
- `APIConnectionError`: Network/connection issues
- `InvalidResponseError`: Invalid API responses
- `FailedToGenerateResponseError`: Generation failures

## 🎛️ Configuration

Common configuration options:
```python
imager = Provider(
    timeout=60,      # Request timeout
    proxies={},      # Proxy settings
    logging=True     # Enable logging
)
```
